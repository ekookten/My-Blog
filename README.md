Title: My-Daily-Blog

Overview:
I have created an engaging landing page for my blog, featuring a form for submitting new posts and a toggle switch for seamless transitions between dark and light modes. Additionally, there is a secondary HTML page for viewing your blog entries, equipped with the same dark/light mode functionality and a "back" button to navigate to the main page. Utilizing local storage, all submitted content is preserved and can be retrieved for display on the blog.html page.

Instructions:
Navigate to the website and fill out the form on the landing page. If any fields are left incomplete, an alert will prompt you to provide the missing information before proceeding. After submitting the form, you can view your blog post on the subsequent page. The toggle switch in the top left corner allows you to effortlessly switch between dark and light modes to suit your preference.
